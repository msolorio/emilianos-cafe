  	  	  <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
  	  	  <p>Emiliano's is happy to make its space available to performers, artists, and poets of all colors and flavors. Also stop by any given afternoon or evening and you may witness some of San Diego's best stop by unannounced and show off their skills. All events at Emiliano's are free of charge.</p>

  	  	      <h3>Friday, July 31</h3>
  	  	  	  <p><strong>4pm. David Glodswortherspeilenstein</strong></p>
  	  	  	  <p>If that name wasn't enough of a mouthful, stop on by for bite to eat, and witness a poetry reading by the man himself.  David takes you on a sensory bending trip through the psyche with his unique and inspiring lyricism.</p>
  	  		    <p><strong>7pm. Little Deedee and the Funkatrons</strong></p>
  	  		    <p>This feisty collective lays down a cookin' blend of soul and latin rhythms, while sultry frontwoman Deedee sours with ease from vista to ascending vista of vocal perfection.</p>

  	  		    <h3>Saturday, August 1</h3>
  	  		    <p><strong>2pm.  Fun with Drums!</strong></p>
  	  		    <p>Come join us for a djembe drum workshop with djembe master Chris Mobeeza.  These workshops are always a hit here at Emiliano's and before you know it you will be pounding away traditional west African rhythms like the Albongo, the Kuku, and the Doundounba.</p>
  	  		    <p><strong>4pm.  Sherrl Shereef</strong></p>
  	  		    <p>The inimitable Ms. Shereef will be showing her 2015 collection of paintings and sculptures.  If you like lamps that don't look like lamps and the artful splattering of yesterday's linguine onto canvas this is one not to be missed.</p>
  	  		    <p><strong>7pm. The Swiss Shreaking Stepsisters</strong></p>
  	  		    <p>This renegade trio of eunichs have been honing their vocal harmonies in the high mountains of Switzerland for the better part of thirty years.  Join us as we explore the upper ranges of altissimo.  It's probably best to leave the precious glassware at home for this one folks.</p>
